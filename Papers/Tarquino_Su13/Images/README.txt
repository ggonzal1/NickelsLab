This section holds the images of the maps acquired throughout the research.

The first bit describes What type of an image this is.
There are three types:
1) Sim: It's the simulated map that was used initially. Has the heart, circle, triangle, square.
2) SimP: The final simulated map, having the diamond, circle, and square
3) Real: The map of the physical environment, modelled after the SimP map

The second bit describes the sensors used to create the map.
An 's' followed by numbers signifies the sensors corresponding to those numbers was used.
For example, s012 used sensor 0, sensor 1, and sensor 2.
A simple "All" means all the sensors were used.
All the "Real" maps used all the sensors

Finally, a description of "Breadcrumbs" or "Ranged" tells respectively if the map turned white only where 
the robot was located, or if it turned white the sonar beams as well.
