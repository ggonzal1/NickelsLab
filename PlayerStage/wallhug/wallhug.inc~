#go straight until hit a wall
#new robot design (square)
#robot have 8 senors, 2 on each side of the robot to sense when it reaches the wall on any side
#one sensor on the rihgt and one on the left, the same all the way around
#this will allow the robot to determine how far away it is and ya, could also do odometry but screw it.
#robot will go straight until it reaches a wall, it will then turn until the sensors on one side of the robot determine the robot to be 1 meter from the wall, having two sensors will assure that #the robot will always be parallel to the wall.
